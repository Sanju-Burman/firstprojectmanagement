## 3. Using Project Boards
Columns:
Milestone	Description	Deadline
Planning	Complete project research	18/11/2024
Design	Finalize UI/UX designs	20/11/2024
Development	Build and integrate features	30/11/2024
Testing	Test functionality and fix bugs	02/12/2024
Launch	Deploy the website	04/12/2024

Five Issues in the "To Do" Column:
Research book categories and genres for cataloging.
Design homepage layout for "Your Library."
Fix payment gateway redirection issues.
Add a "Best Sellers" section to the homepage.
Test mobile responsiveness across devices.
Usage Plan:
The project board will serve as a visual tracking tool to monitor progress. Issues will move between columns as they are addressed, ensuring transparency. Each task is assigned to team members with due dates to maintain accountability. This approach promotes effective collaboration and minimizes delays.


## 4. Linking Issues to Milestones
Linked Issues
"Develop User Authentication Module":

Topic: This is a key issue for deploying the site. Without authentication of users, there can be no further step in creating an account or purchasing books.
"Implement Wishlist Functionality":

Reason: This is an optional feature but one that brings users a feeling of value into this system. It aligns with a milestone in having a fully functional, user-friendly library.
Both issues help ensure that the milestone will deliver a product that is functional and engaging.

## 5. Reflection on Project Management Tools
Using GitHub's project management features, such as milestones, issues, and project boards, has significant benefits for team collaboration and organization.

Advantages:
Centralized Communication: Issues provide a platform for detailed discussions and tracking progress, reducing miscommunication.
Prioritization: Labels and milestones help prioritize tasks effectively, ensuring critical issues are addressed first.
Progress Monitoring: Project boards offer a clear overview of the project's status, allowing team members to focus on current priorities.
Accountability: Assigning tasks to specific members ensures responsibilities are clear and fosters accountability.
Anticipated Challenges:
Learning Curve: Team members unfamiliar with GitHub may require training to use these tools effectively.
Overhead: Maintaining issues, boards, and milestones requires regular updates, which could add to the workload.
Scope Creep: Without clear boundaries, new tasks or feature requests could derail progress on current objectives.
In short, by using GitHub tools for managing projects, collaboration becomes smooth, and the "Your Library" project will be completed on time, with all team members towards the shared goal.
