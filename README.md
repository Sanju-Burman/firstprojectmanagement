## 1. Developing Milestones
### Milestone Name:
"Deploy the Your Library Web application"

### Description:
This marks the culmination of the development phase, as core functionalities such as creating an account for the user, browsing through books, and purchase workflows would be completed. The focus would be on building a functional and user-friendly web-based system.

Deadline:
December 10, 2024

Importance:
This will therefore make "Your Library" ready for public use. In combination, all the tasks, including e-commerce system integration, payment gateways setup, as well as the test of user interactions, ensure a seamless experience.

## 2. Issue Resolution
Bug Report:
Title: "Error in the Book Search Functionality"
Description: The functionality to search for books is not returning book titles for queries with special characters, such as apostrophes. This makes it impossible for users to find titles like Harry's Adventures.
Assigned To: [Name of Team Member]
Labels: bug, high-priority
Feature Request:
Title: "Add Wishlist Functionality"
Description: Provide the facility for customers to bookmark books as their wishlist for buying or referencing later. This would enhance customer interaction and retention.
Assigned To: [Name of Team Member]
Labels: enhancement, medium-priority
Task:

Description: Establish a secure and valid method for user registration, login, and password recovery. Add functionality such as mail-based verification and hashed passwords.
Assigned To: [Name of Team Member]
Labels: task, critical
## 3. Using Project Boards
Columns:
To Do: Write out all the pending tasks and bugs.
In Progress: Track all tasks currently in the works.
Done: Highlight all the tasks that are completed.
Five Issues in the "To Do" Column
Research book categories and genres for cataloging
Design homepage layout for "Your Library."
Fix payment gateway redirection issues.
Add a "Best Sellers" section to the homepage.
Test the mobile responsiveness of the site on all devices.
Usage Plan:
Issues will be in columns, and as these are discussed, issues will move between the columns, thereby providing a history of how issues were solved, shown above. Each task has been assigned to team members with due dates to ensure accountability. Therefore, this is effective collaboration and no more delays.

## 4. Linking Issues to Milestones
Linked Issues
"Develop User Authentication Module":

Topic: This is a key issue for deploying the site. Without authentication of users, there can be no further step in creating an account or purchasing books.
"Implement Wishlist Functionality":

Reason: This is an optional feature but one that brings users a feeling of value into this system. It aligns with a milestone in having a fully functional, user-friendly library.
Both issues help ensure that the milestone will deliver a product that is functional and engaging.

## 5. Reflection on Project Management Tools
Using GitHub's project management features, such as milestones, issues, and project boards, has significant benefits for team collaboration and organization.

Advantages:
Centralized Communication: Issues provide a platform for detailed discussions and tracking progress, reducing miscommunication.
Prioritization: Labels and milestones help prioritize tasks effectively, ensuring critical issues are addressed first.
Progress Monitoring: Project boards offer a clear overview of the project's status, allowing team members to focus on current priorities.
Accountability: Assigning tasks to specific members ensures responsibilities are clear and fosters accountability.
Anticipated Challenges:
Learning Curve: Team members unfamiliar with GitHub may require training to use these tools effectively.
Overhead: Maintaining issues, boards, and milestones requires regular updates, which could add to the workload.
Scope Creep: Without clear boundaries, new tasks or feature requests could derail progress on current objectives.
In short, by using GitHub tools for managing projects, collaboration becomes smooth, and the "Your Library" project will be completed on time, with all team members towards the shared goal.
